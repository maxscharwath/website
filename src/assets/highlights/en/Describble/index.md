[Describble](https://describble.io) is an innovative whiteboard application designed to enhance collaboration and bring your ideas to life. My bachelor's thesis, titled "Collaborative Editing of Structured Documents with End-to-End Encryption and Distributed Storage", laid the foundation for the development of this platform. It offers a unique approach to collaborative editing while ensuring data confidentiality through end-to-end encryption.

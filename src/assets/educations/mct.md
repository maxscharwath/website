Preparatory year, where I studied **Electronics and Automation**. 
This year was a great opportunity to learn about project management, electronics, automation, and programming.
During the last semester, I had the chance to work on a project for an **Escape Room**.
We had to design and build some connected devices, and a server to manage the game.
